This calculator is based on the calculator assignment from 'The Odin Project'. However, instead of only performing one operation before accepting the next, this calculator works based on PEMDAS (parenthesis, exponents, multiplication/division (L to R), addition/subtraction (L to R). Factorials are performed after parentheses but before operators requiring two operands.
